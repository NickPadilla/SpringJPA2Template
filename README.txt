This project is a quickstart using Spring 3.1 MVC and JPA 2.0 with Metamodels.  There is a docs folder that goes through
all the different items associated with this project.  Problems.txt includes the known limitations and bugs with the new
frameworks. Currently everything is built for Tomcat.  It takes a bit of time to start up, think it is the JNDI loading.  You 
can setup datasource information from the src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml.

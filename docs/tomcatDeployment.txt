When deploying to tomcat you need to ensure you add these jars to the lib dir for the instance you deploy to:

javax.servlet-api.3.0.1
org.springframework.instrument.tomcat

Only worry about these if you are going to use these for db connections - 
if so add them to the pom.xml as well to be safe. If you don't need these don't worry about it.

LazyLoading does't work on OneToOne and OneToMany mappings, this is because of a problem in how weaving 
happens with Tomcat.  I have opened a thread here : 
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?121502-Spring-3-1-EclipseLink-2-3-2-Tomcat-7-Load-Time-Weaving

Created this Spring Bug for the LAZY loading issue:
https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAJPA-157

need to expand on the type safe queries, nothing really built for it - just a test impl. Here is some really
good information on how to use the Typesafe queries in detail:

Follow this Hibernate-Validator issue and upgrade once 4.3 is released, it will have the class level validation 
annotation bug fixed:  https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HV-524

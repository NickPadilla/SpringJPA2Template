Everything is setup to use an in memory database for testing.  All is well when run using maven, but for junit to run with no problems
we need to add the -javaagent: switch to the environment variables. You can use these steps to get this to work:

1. Open Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs
2. Select the JRE in use by the project. Click Edit.
3. Add to the 'Default VM Arguments' field this:

-javaagent:"${project_loc}/src/test/resources/spring-instrument-3.1.1.RELEASE.jar"

Should be good to go running your unit/integration tests using just JUnit.
